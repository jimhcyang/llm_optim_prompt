I can help you with your questions.

**Boston to San Francisco**

It appears that American Airlines is not a valid option for this route, as there are no direct flights between Boston and San Francisco. However, I'll provide you with some alternative options:

* Delta Air Lines: 1 stop in Atlanta (e.g., Delta's non-stop flight from Boston Logan International Airport to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport)
* United Airlines: 1 stop in Los Angeles (e.g., United's non-stop flight from Boston Logan International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport)

Here is an example query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.flight_id FROM flight f
JOIN airline a ON f.airline_code = a.airline_code
WHERE a.airline_name = 'Delta' OR a.airline_name = 'United'
AND f.from_airport = 'BOS'
AND f.to_airport = 'LAX';
```
This query will return flights with Delta or United that depart from Boston and arrive at Los Angeles.

**Boston to Atlanta**

Here is an example query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.flight_id FROM flight f
JOIN airline a ON f.airline_code = a.airline_code
WHERE a.airline_name = 'American'
AND f.from_airport = 'BOS'
AND f.to_airport = 'ATL';
```
This query will return flights with American that depart from Boston and arrive at Atlanta.

**Newark to Boston**

Here are the flight times for some examples:

* Delta Air Lines:
	+ Departing Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR): 1 hour, 15 minutes
	+ Arriving Boston Logan International Airport (BOS): 1 hour, 30 minutes
* United Airlines:
	+ Departing Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR): 1 hour, 25 minutes
	+ Arriving Boston Logan International Airport (BOS): 2 hours
* American Airlines:
	+ Departing Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR): 1 hour, 20 minutes
	+ Arriving Boston Logan International Airport (BOS): 1 hour, 35 minutes

Please note that these flight times are approximate and may vary depending on the airline, flight schedule, and other factors.

**Flight Times from Denver to San Francisco**

Here is an example query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.flight_id FROM fare f
JOIN flight_fare ff ON f.fare_id = ff.fare_id
JOIN flight flight ON ff.flight_id = flight.flight_id
WHERE flight.from_airport = 'DEN'
AND flight.to_airport = 'SFO';
```
This query will return flights from Denver to San Francisco.

The flight times for some examples:

* Non-stop: 5 hours, 30 minutes (Delta Air Lines)
* With a layover: around 6-7 hours (e.g., United Airlines' non-stop flight with a layover in Los Angeles)

Please note that these flight times are approximate and may vary depending on the airline, flight schedule, and other factors.
