How is the weather today?

[Model (llama3.2:1b)]
I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. However, I can suggest some ways for you to find out how the weather is today.

You can check online weather websites or apps such as:

- AccuWeather
- Weather.com
- National Weather Service (NWS)
- Your local news website or social media

These sources provide up-to-date weather forecasts and conditions for your location.
