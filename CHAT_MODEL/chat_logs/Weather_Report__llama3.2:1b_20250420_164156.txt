How is the weather today?

[Model (llama3.2:1b)]
I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. However, I can suggest some ways for you to find out how the weather is today.

You can check the weather forecast on websites like AccuWeather, Weather.com, or the National Weather Service (NWS) for the most up-to-date and accurate information about the current weather conditions in your area.

If you want to know what the weather will be like tomorrow or this weekend, I recommend checking those same websites again. They usually have a forecast section where they provide detailed information about future weather patterns.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
