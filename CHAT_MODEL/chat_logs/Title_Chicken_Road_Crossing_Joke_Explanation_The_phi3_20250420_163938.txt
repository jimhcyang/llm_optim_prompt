[Model (phi3)]
The humor in the classic "Why did the chicken cross the road?" joke comes from its straightforward interpretation that leads to an absurd or unexpected punchline. The setup of the question is simple and easy for listeners of all ages, creating anticipation as they expect a complex reason behind such action by the animal - crossing roads are generally seen with risk in mind due to potential hazards like vehicles. However, when you reveal that "To get to the other side!" which seems mundane at first but is also what chickens do on one road leads back to their natural behavior of moving from place to place for various reasons such as food or nesting grounds - it becomes a playful exaggeration. 

The punchline plays upon this expectation by suggesting that the reason behind crossing roads could be anything but something inherently risky, simply because chickens do cross paths regularly in their daily activities. Thus, 'to get to the other side' is not only literal (the purpose for many of us as well), it also pokes fun at our expectations about what might motivate such an action from a non-human subject.

This joke wouldn't generally be classified as meta since jokes in that context refer back to the nature or form of humor itself, often commenting on another aspect of comedy within their own narrative and not merely relying on language play for humour without necessarily doing so directly about its structure - which is a feature commonly found in many simple knock-knock jokes. Instead, this joke plays with expectations based on human behavior applied to an animal character performing the same action we do: crossing from one side of something (like road) to another for reasons that might seem trivial or non-existent but still make sense considering their natural instincts and patterns â€“ hence it's a form of 'pure absurdity'.
