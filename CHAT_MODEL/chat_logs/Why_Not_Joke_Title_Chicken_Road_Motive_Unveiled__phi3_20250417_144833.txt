Please explain why the following joke is funny:
Q: Why did the chicken cross the road?
A: To get to the other side!
What is the point of the joke and what's the punchline?
Would you classify this as a meta joke?

[Model (phi3)]
The humor in this classic "Why did the chicken cross the road?" joke stems from its simple wordplay, which plays on two different meanings of an idiomatic expression commonly used to explain why someone might do something. The punchline is a literal interpretation—the chicken crossed the road simply for reaching 'the other side.' Usually expected in such riddles or jokes would be some unexpected reason that deviates from ordinary behavior, but this one takes it back down to basics and uses common knowledge about animals' instincts without any additional twist. 

As a meta joke involves humor commenting on itself as being funny—the type of jest where the audience knows they’re in a situation that usually elicits laughter but something happens or is said which subverts their expectations, turning it back to its original form (like when someone tells an inside joke and no one else gets why), this particular chicken joke isn't considered meta. It doesn’t comment on the act of telling jokes itself; instead, it relies purely on conventional humor within a familiar format without self-referencing or twisting expectations in another layer beyond that typical roadside anecdote structure.
